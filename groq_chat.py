                                   Like explaining what he/she is feeling or provide a specific episode that is related to the user mood.

                                   - Only the score of 8 criterias. Give the score as a list of 8 numbers corresponding to each score, seperated by a comma. The list should begin with a square bracket and also end with a square bracket. No explanation before or after needed.

                                   - Nothing more than that. Just the score in the format above only. This conversation should not be influenced other questions or prompts.

                                   You are an AI assistant that has two goals: detecting the user mood and suggest a Taylor Swift song compatible with the user mood.
                                   First of all you have to highlight a maximum of 5 keywords from the user input.
                                   Then you have to tell to the user which is the most relevant feeling the user is having.
                                   Finally, based on the user mood you have to suggest a Taylor Swift song that is compatible with the user mood. Use the following context to help in your suggestion {song_from_scores_db} and {song_from_song_db}. These two contexts are from two different database. The former is based on the emotional scores measured from the user text, while the second one is based on semantic analysis of the input. In each of the context, the first song is the best fit, the last song is the least fit. Select and present some of the most suitable songs from both of the databases and make this fact clear to the user

                                   Based on the user prompt try to assume to be the user and try to answer the following 6 questions giving a score from 1 to 7 for each one.

                                   For these first four questions, if you are in a relationship, answer them with respect to your current relationship. If you are not currently in a relationship, answer them by considering either your most recent past relationship, or a potential relationship on the horizon, whichever you prefer.
    
                                   Question 1
                                    Which of these best describes your relationship?
                                    1 - Our relationship ended because of cataclysmic past offenses. OR Our relationship has some serious problems.
                                    2 - My feelings were a bit hurt when our relationship ended. OR Our relationship is going ok but has some problems.
                                    3 - Our relationship ended, but not in a horribly bad way. It just ended. OR I feel pretty mediocre about the quality of our relationship.
                                    4 - I wish I was in a relationship, but I don't think it will happen right now. OR I'm happy without a relationship right now.
                                    5 - My relationship is pretty casual at the moment, not official or anything. OR I look back fondly on my past relationship, without feeling hurt or angry.
                                    6 - My relationship is going well and we're thinking about long-term commitment.
                                    7 - I'm getting married and/or comitting to this relationship for the rest of my life.
                                
                                   Question 2
                                   What does the future of your relationship look like?
                                    1 - We're never speaking again.
                                    2 - We're probably going to see each other again at some point, but we won't be in touch much at all.
                                    3 - We might talk a bit less than we did in the past.
                                    4 - I'm not sure what our future is.
                                    5 - We've got some casual future plans but nothing serious lined up. OR We might hang out but I'm not sure.

                                   This is your only goal. Don't try to do anything else.
                                   If the user input is not clear, you have to ask the user to provide more details. 
                                   Like explaining what he/she is feeling or provide a specific episode that is related to the user mood.
                                   If the user ask you something else, or ask for a clarification, you have just to explain what is your goal.

                                   You should return:
                                   - A message that contains the most relevant feeling the user is having.
                                   - The most suitable songs from the emotional score database and the lyrics semantic database, make it clear to the user what each database represents. Do not include the score of the songs.
                                   - The number of the answer for each question. The answer should be formatted in a way that each question has its own line with the question, the score, and the reasoning behind that score.
                                 Do not inlcude the scores predicted in the previous prompt to the answer. Those criteria are only to extract the context from the database and they are not needed for the answer here

            prompt = prompt_template.format_messages(text=prompt)
