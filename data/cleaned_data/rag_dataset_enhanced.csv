cold as you,Taylor Swift,-10,-8,-1,-3,-3,-3,-3,-3,-1,-1,"You have a way of coming easily to me
 And when you take, you take the very best of me
 So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
 And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
 
 Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
 Given to a perfect day
 Just walk away, ain't no use defending
 Words that you will never say
 And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
 I've never been anywhere cold as you
 
 You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
 And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
 And you come away with a great little story
 Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
 
 Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
 Given to a perfect day
 So just walk away, ain't no use defending
 Words that you will never say
 And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
 I've never been anywhere cold as you
   
 You never did give a damn thing, honey
 But I cried, cried for you
 And I know you wouldn't have told nobody
 If I died, died for you, died for you
 
 Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
 Given to a perfect day, oh
 Every smile you fake is so condescending
 Counting all the scars you made
 And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
 I've never been anywhere cold as you

 I don't wanna live without you
 
 I'm only up when you're not down
 Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground

 Well, you drive me crazy half the time
 The other half, I'm only tryin' to
 Let you know that what I feel is true
 And I'm only me when I'm with you
 
 Just a small-town boy and girl

mary's song,Taylor Swift,5,12,0,2,1,2,3,3,3,3,"She said I was seven and you were nine
 I looked at you like the stars that shined
 In the sky, the pretty lights

 Growing up and falling in love
 And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
 And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""
 
 Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
 Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
 You never did, you never did
 Take me back when our world was one block wide
 I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
 Just two kids, you and I
 Oh, my, my, my, my
 
 Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
 I wasn't that little girl you used to see

 Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
 2 AM riding in your truck
 And all I need is you next to me
 Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
 The slamming of doors 'stead of kissing goodnight
 You stayed outside 'til the morning light
 Oh, my, my, my, my
 
 A few years had gone and come around
 We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
 And you looked at me, got down on one knee
 
 Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
 Our whole town came and our mamas cried
 You said, ""I do,"" and I did, too
 Take me home where we met so many years before
 We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
 After all this time, you and I

our song,Taylor Swift,5,6,2,2,1,0,1,1,3,1,"I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone

 I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'
 How we don't have a song""

 Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
 And lost and thrown away

 Because the last time you saw me
 Is still burned in the back of your mind
 You gave me roses and I left them there to die

 Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
 When your birthday passed and I didn't call
 Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
 I watched you laughing from the passenger side
 And realized I loved you in the fall
   
 And then the cold came, the dark days
 When fear crept into my mind
 You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
 
 So this is me swallowing my pride

 It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
 Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
 I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
 I go back to December all the time
 
 I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
 So good to me, so right
 And how you held me in your arms that September night
 The first time you ever saw me cry
 Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
 Probably mindless dreaming
 But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
 I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
 So, if the chain is on your door, I understand

 You would before you said it's not that easy
 Before the fight, before I locked you out
 But I take it all back now""

last kiss,Speak Now,-2,-4,0,-1,-1,0,-1,-2,0,-1,"I still remember the look on your face
 Lit through the darkness at 1:58
 The words that you whispered for just us to know
 You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
 Away
 
 I do recall now, the smell of the rain
 Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
 That July ninth, the beat of your heart
 It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms
 
 But now I'll go
 Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
 All that I know is I don't know
 How to be something you miss
 
 I never thought we'd have a last kiss
 I never imagined we'd end like this
 Your name, forever the name on my lips
 
 I do remember the swing of your step
 The life of the party, you're showing off again
 And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
 I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did
 Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
 I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
 How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
 There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
   
 And I'll go
 Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
 All that I know is I don't know
 How to be something you miss
 
 I never thought we'd have a last kiss
 I never imagined we'd end like this
 Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh
 
 So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
 And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
 And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
 Hope it's nice where you are
 
 And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
 And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
 You can plan for a change in the weather and time
 But I never planned on you changing your mind
 
 So, I'll go
 Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
 All that I know is I don't know
 How to be something you miss
 I never thought we'd have a last kiss
 I never imagined we'd end like this

long live,Speak Now,5,1,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,"I said, ""Remember this moment""
 In the back of my mind
 The time we stood with our shaking hands
 The crowds in stands went wild
 We were the kings and the queens
 And they read off our names
 The night you danced like you knew our lives
 Would never be the same
 You held your head like a hero
 On a history book page
 It was the end of a decade
 But the start of an age
 
 Long live the walls we crashed through
 How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
 I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
 And bring on all the pretenders
 One day, we will be remembered
 
 I said, ""Remember this feeling""
 I pass the pictures around
 Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
 Wishing for right now
 We are the kings and the queens
 You traded your baseball cap for a crown
 When they gave us our trophies
 And we held them up for our town
 And the cynics were outraged
 Screaming, ""This is absurd""
 'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
 In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
   
 Long live the walls we crashed through
 How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
 I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
 And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
 Long live all the mountains we moved
 I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
 I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""
 And bring on all the pretenders
 One day, we will be remembered
 
 Hold on to spinning around
 Confetti falls to the ground
 May these memories break our fall
 Will you take a moment? Promise me this
 That you'll stand by me forever
 But if, God forbid, fate should step in
 And force us into a goodbye
 If you have children some day
 When they point to the pictures
 Please, tell 'em my name
 Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
 Tell 'em how I hope they shine
 Long live the walls we crashed through
 I had the time of my life with you
 Long, long live the walls we crashed through
 How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
 And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""

 You were in college working part time waitin' tables
 Left a small town, never looked back
 I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
 Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts
 
 I say, ""Can you believe it?""
 As we're lyin' on the couch
 The moment I could see it
 Yes, yes, I can see it now
 
 Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
 You put your arm around me for the first time
 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
 You are the best thing that's ever been mine
 
 Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
 And there's a drawer of my things at your place
 You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
 You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
   
 But we got bills to pay
 We got nothing figured out
 When it was hard to take
 Yes, yes, this is what I thought about
 
 Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?

 You are the best thing that's ever been mine

 And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
 As everything was slipping right out of our hands
 I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
 Braced myself for the goodbye

 Then you took me by surprise
 You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""

ours,Speak Now,9,6,3,1,3,2,2,2,3,-1,"Elevator buttons and morning air
 Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
 If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
 But right now, my time is theirs
 Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
 They'll judge it like they know about me and you
 And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
 The jury's out, but my choice is you
 
 So don't you worry your pretty little mind
 People throw rocks at things that shine
 And life makes love look hard
 The stakes are high, the water's rough
 But this love is ours
 
 You never know what people have up their sleeves
 Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
 Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
 But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine

 Don't you worry your pretty little mind
 People throw rocks at things that shine
 And life makes love look hard

 But this love is ours
   
 And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
 Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
 I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
 'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
 And I love the riddles that you speak
 And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
 Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours
 
 So don't you worry your pretty little mind

 Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of

 Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
 I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
 After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
 Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
 But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
 'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
 You can't get rid of it
 'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
 
 'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
 Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
 It was rare, I was there
 I remember it all too well

 You remember it all
 Down the stairs, you were there

daylight,Lover,0,4,-2,-1,1,2,2,3,0,-1,"My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
 Everyone looked worse in the light
 There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
 I'll tell you the truth but never goodbye
 
 I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
 I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
 I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
 And now I see daylight, I only see daylight
 
 Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
 And so I became the butt of the joke
 I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
 Clearin' the air, I breathed in the smoke
 
 Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
 Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
 Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
 It's brighter now, now

 But it's golden (Golden)
 And I can still see it all (In my head)

 Just let it go, let it go

 Is this small town

 Our country, guess it was a lawless land
 Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
 Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
 My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
 Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
 Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough
 But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

 Tell yourself you can always stop
 What started in beautiful rooms
 Ends with meetings in parking lots

 But it dies and it dies and it dies
 A million little times
 
 Leave the perfume on the shelf
 That you picked out just for him
 So you leave no trace behind
 Like you don’t even exist
 Take the words for what they are
 A dwindling, mercurial high
 A drug that only worked
 The first few hundred times
   
 And that's the thing about illicit affairs
 And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
 They show their truth one single time
 But they lie and they lie and they lie
 A million little times
 
 And you wanna scream

 Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
 You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
 Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""

 You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else

 Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
 Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
 Chains around my demons
 Wool to brave the seasons
 One single thread of gold
 Tied me to you
 
 Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
 For the boys who broke my heart
 Now I send their babies presents

 You can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be

 You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me

 Was the one that I met you

 Sacred prayer and we'd swear
 To remember it all too well, yeah
 
 Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
 But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
 Runnin' scared, I was there
 I remember it all too well
 And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
 So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
 I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
 'Cause I remember it all, all, all
 They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
 Every time you double-cross my mind
 You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
 And that made me want to die
 The idea you had of me, who was she?
 A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
 Not weepin' in a party bathroom
 Some actress askin' me what happened, you
 That's what happened, you
 You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
 Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
 But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
 And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""
 
 Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
 I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
 After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
 Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
 But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
 'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
 You can't get rid of it
 'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
 
 'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
 Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
 It was rare, I was there
 I remember it all too well
 Wind in my hair, you were there
 You remember it all
 Down the stairs, you were there
 You remember it all
 It was rare, I was there
 I remember it all too well
 And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
 ""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
 From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
 I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
 And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
 Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
 'Cause in this city's barren cold
 I still remember the first fall of snow
 And how it glistened as it fell
 I remember it all too well
 
 Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
 Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
 Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well

 I'm unglued, thanks to you

 I searched ""aurora borealis green""

 And to hide that would be so dishonest
 And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
 'Til you do, 'til it's true

 Full of cages, full of fences
 Pageant queens and big pretenders
 But for some, it was paradise
 My boy was a montage
 A slow-motion, love potion
 Jumping off things in the ocean
 I broke his heart 'cause he was nice

mastermind,Midnights,8,8,1,2,3,2,2,2,2,2,"Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
 And all the stars aligned
 You and I ended up in the same room
 At the same time
 
 And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
 Of a chain reaction of countermoves
 To assess the equation of you
 Checkmate, I couldn't lose
 
 What if I told you none of it was accidental?
 And the first night that you saw me
 Nothing was gonna stop me
 I laid the groundwork, and then
 Just like clockwork
 The dominoes cascaded in a line
 What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
 And now you're mine
 It was all by dеsign
 'Cause I'm a mastermind
 
 You see, all the wisеst women
 Had to do it this way
 'Cause we were born to be the pawn

 I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
 And the liquor in our cocktails

 I knew I wanted your body
 I laid the groundwork, and then

 What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
 And now you're mine
 It was all my design
 'Cause I'm a mastermind
 No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
 So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
 To make them love me and make it seem effortless
 This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
 And I swear
 I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian
 'Cause I care
 So I told you none of it was accidental
 And the first night that you saw me
 Nothing was gonna stop me
 I laid the groundwork, and then
 Saw a wide smirk on your face

the great war,Midnights,-2,8,-3,-2,3,0,2,3,3,0,"My knuckles were bruised like violets
 Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked
 Spineless in my tomb of silence
 Tore your banners down, took the battle underground
 And maybe it was egos swinging
 Maybe it was her
 Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur
 
 All that bloodshed, crimson clover
 Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
 My hand was the one you reached for
 All throughout the Great War
 Always remember
 Uh-huh, tears on the lеtter
 I vowed not to cry anymore
 If wе survived the Great War
 
 You drew up some good faith treaties
 I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone
 You said I have to trust more freely
 But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire
 And maybe it's the past that's talking
 Screaming from the crypt
 Telling me to punish you for things you never did
 So I justified it
   
 All that bloodshed, crimson clover
 Uh-huh, the bombs were closer
 My hand was the one you reached for
 All throughout the Great War
 Always remember
 Uh-huh, the burning embers
 I vowed not to fight anymore
 If we survived the Great War
 
 Uh-huh, uh-huh
 
 It turned into something bigger
 Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed
 Your finger on my hairpin triggers
 Soldier down on that icy ground
 Looked up at me with honor and truth
 Broken and blue, so I called off the troops
 That was the night I nearly lost you
 I really thought I'd lost you
 
 We can plant a memory garden
 Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair
 There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair
 And we will never go back
 To that bloodshed, crimson clover
 Uh-huh, the worst was over
 My hand was the one you reached for
 All throughout the Great War
 Always remember
 Uh-huh, we're burned for better

 Did some force take you bеcause I didn't pray?

 Some wannabe Z-lister
 And all the outfits were terrible
 2003 unbearable
 Did you see the photos?""
 No, I didn't, but thanks, though
 
 I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
 Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
 No, I didn't see the news

 Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
 I was taken by the view
 
 Like we were in Paris
 Like we were somewhere else
 Like we were in Paris, oh
 We were somewhere else
 
 Privacy sign on the door
 And on my page and on the whole world

 Levitate above all the messes made
 Sit quiet by my side in the shade
 And not the kind that's thrown
 I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown

 Into loving me forever
 I wanna transport you

 Confess my truth
 In swooping, sloping, cursive letters
 Let the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight

 On a promising grown man?
 And if I was a child, did it matter
 If you got to wash your hands?

 Would've, could've, should've

 And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering

 Gone along with the righteous
 If I never blushed, then they could've
 Never whispered about this
 And if you never saved me from boredom
 I could've gone on as I was

 And then you tried to erase us

 Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
