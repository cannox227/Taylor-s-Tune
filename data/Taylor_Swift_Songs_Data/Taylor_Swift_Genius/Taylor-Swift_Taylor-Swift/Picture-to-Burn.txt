State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears, I'm just sittin' here planning my revenge
There's nothing stoppin' me from goin' out with all of your best friends
And if you come around sayin' sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show ya how sorry you'll be

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really, really hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn31Embed
