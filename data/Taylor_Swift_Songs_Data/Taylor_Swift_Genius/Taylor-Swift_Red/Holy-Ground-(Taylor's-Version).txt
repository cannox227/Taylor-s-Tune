I was reminiscing just the other day
While havin' coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feelin' on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darlin', it was good
Never lookin' down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinnin' like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
Wе block the noise with the sound of, "I need you"
And for thе first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But, sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

'Cause, darlin', it was good (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
Never lookin' down (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
And right there where we stood (Ooh-ayy)
Was holy ground

Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah
Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah

Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancin' with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancin' with you

It was good
I'm never lookin' down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah
Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah

Tonight, I'm gonna dance (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
For all that we've been through (Ooh-ayy, oh-woah)
But I don't wanna dance (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
If I'm not dancin' with you (Ooh-ayy, oh-woah)
Tonight, I'm gonna dance (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
Like you were in this room (Ooh-ayy, oh-woah)
But I don't wanna dance (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
If I'm not dancin' with you19Embed
