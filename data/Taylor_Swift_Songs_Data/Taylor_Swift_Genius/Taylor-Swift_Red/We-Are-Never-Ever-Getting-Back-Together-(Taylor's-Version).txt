I remember when we broke up the first time
Sayin', "This is it, I've had enough"
'Cause, like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space, what?
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"

Ooh, we called it off again last night, but
Ooh, this time, I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you

We are never, evеr, ever gettin' back togеther
We are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together

Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you pickin' fights
And me fallin' for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine (Haha)

Ooh, you called me up again tonight, but
Ooh, this time, I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you (Oh)

We (We) are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
We are never, ever, ever (Ever) gettin' back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together

Ooh (Yeah), ooh (Yeah)
Ooh (Yeah), oh

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, "Never say never"
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's, like, "I still love you"
And I'm, like, I'm just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together
Like, ever (No)

We are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
We are never, ever, ever (Oh) gettin' back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (To me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together
We (Ooh), no
Gettin' back together (Ooh)
We (Ooh), oh
Gettin' back together (Ooh), yeah
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together12Embed
