You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself, "Don't get attached"
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feelin' sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

The delicate beginnin' rush
The feelin' you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feelin' sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is fallin' for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around
This is when the feelin' sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

Oh, oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh, oh

Come back, be here
Come back, be here16Embed
