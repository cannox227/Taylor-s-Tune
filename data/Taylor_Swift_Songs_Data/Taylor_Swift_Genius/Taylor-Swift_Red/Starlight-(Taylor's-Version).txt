I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picks me up late one night, out the window
We were seventeen and crazy, runnin' wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playin' whеn we walked in
The night wе snuck into a yacht club party
Pretendin' to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change"
"You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinkin' that way"
He was tryin' to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?"
"Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh, ooh, he's talkin' crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancin' with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

(Ooh-hoo-hoo)
(Ooh-hoo-hoo)
(Ooh-hoo-hoo)
(Ooh-hoo-hoo)

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?9Embed
