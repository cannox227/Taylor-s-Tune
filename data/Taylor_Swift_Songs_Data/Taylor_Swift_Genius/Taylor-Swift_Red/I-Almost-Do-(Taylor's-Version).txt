I bet, this time of night, you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long, hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window lookin' out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder 'bout me

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't, I almost do
I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't, I almost do
I almost do

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It's probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
In my dreams, you're touchin' my face
And asking me if I'd wanna try again with you
And I almost do

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't, I almost do
I almost do

(Ooh)

I bet, this time of night, you’re still up
I bet you're tired from a long, hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window lookin' out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder 'bout me17Embed
