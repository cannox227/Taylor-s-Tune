You good to go?

All I knew this mornin' when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind makin' me feel like

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you
Know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like comin' homе
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changеd
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday, yeah
Is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, makin' up for lost time
Takin' flight, makin' me feel like

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you
Know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like comin' home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday, yeah
Is everything has changed
Come back and tell me why
I'm feelin' like I've missed you all this time (Oh-oh-oh)
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind-ind-ind

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you
Know you, know you

All I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like comin' home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday, yeah
Is everything has changed

All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pourin' rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday, yeah
Is everything has changed10Embed
