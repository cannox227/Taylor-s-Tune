Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits ya
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it’s all the same, another time and place
Repeatin' history and you're gettin’ sick of it

But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change, can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

So we've been outnumbered, raidеd and, now, cornered
It's hard to fight when thе fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we’re faster and never scared

You can walk away, say, "We don’t need this"
But there's somethin’ in your eyes, says, "We can beat this"

'Cause these things will change, can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh-woah

Tonight, we’ll stand and get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed, can you see it now?
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up 'cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah, oh
