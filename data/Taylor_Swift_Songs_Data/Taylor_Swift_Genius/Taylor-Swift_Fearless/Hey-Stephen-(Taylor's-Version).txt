Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah

Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceivin'
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked, we were talkin'
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believin'
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Mm, mmm
Oh-woah, mmm

Hey Stephen, I've been holdin' back this feelin'
So I've got some things to say to you, huh
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leavin'?
I think you and I should stay the same

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Mmm, mmm

They're dimming the street lights
You're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waitin' alone now
So come on and come out
And pull me near
And shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you? Haha

I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Oh-oh, myself
Mmm, I can't help myself
I can't help myself, oh-oh-oh
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm18Embed
