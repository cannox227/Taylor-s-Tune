This is wrong, but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothin' more right, babe
Misty mornin' comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
I knew from the first note played
I'd be breakin' all my rules to see you

You smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
"I can't keep my eyes off of you"
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

Mornin' lonelinеss comes around when I'm not
Dreamin' about you
Whеn my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you

You smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
"I can't take my eyes off of you"
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
"I can't take my eyes off of you"
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar
Sweet, sweet superstar
