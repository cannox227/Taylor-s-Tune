All this time, I was wastin', hopin' you would come around
I've been givin' out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinkin' we'll be fine again, but not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, no, no

You're lookin' so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't lеft me waitin' in the cold
And you've got your sharе of secrets and I'm tired of bein' last to know, oh
And now you're askin' me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no
You're not sorry
No, no

You had me crawlin' for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothin' left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no
You're not sorry
No, no

No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no
No, no, no, no
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no
No, no14Embed
