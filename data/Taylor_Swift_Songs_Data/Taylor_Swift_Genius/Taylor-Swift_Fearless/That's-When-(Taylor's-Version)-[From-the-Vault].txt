You said, "I know"
When I said, "I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this"
And you watched me go
And I knew my words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back

And I said, "When can I-I-I come back?"

And you said, "That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
Laughin', when I'm cryin'
And that's when
I'll be waitin' at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in and, baby, that's when"

Mmm, mm

I said, "I know"
When you said, "I did you wrong, made mistakes
And put you through all of this" (Through all of this)
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said, "Leave those all in our past"

And you said, "When can I-I-I come back?"

And I said, "That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
Laughin', when I'm cryin'
And that's when
I'll be waitin' at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in and, baby, that's when"

And you said, "Honestly
When you were gone
Did you ever think of me?"

And I said, "That's when
When I woke up in the morning
That's when it was sunny or stormin'
Laughin', when I was cryin'
And that's when
You were waitin' at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby, that's when"
(That's when)
(When I woke up in the morning) Yeah
(That's when it was sunny or stormin')
When I'm laughin', when I'm cryin'
(That's when I'll be waitin' at the front gate)
That's when I miss you, that's when I want you
(That's when, when I see your face)
That's when I love you, that's when16Embed
