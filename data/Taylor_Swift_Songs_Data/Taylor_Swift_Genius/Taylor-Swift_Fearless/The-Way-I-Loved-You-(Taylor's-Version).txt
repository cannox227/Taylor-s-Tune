He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear
And it's like I couldn't ask for anything better

He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, "You look beautiful tonight"
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursin' your name
So in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and comin' undone
It's a, a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

But I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursin' your name
So in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and comin' undone
It's a, a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm fakin'
And my heart's not breakin'
'Cause I'm not feelin' anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating, intoxicatin', complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain
It's 2 AM and I'm cursin' your name
So in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and comin' undone
It's a, a rollercoaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
Woah, woah, oh-oh
Oh, and that's the way I loved you
Oh, oh, oh-woah, oh, oh, oh-woah
Never knew I could feel that much
That's the way I loved you13Embed
