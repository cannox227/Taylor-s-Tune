I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, I'm better off bein' alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me "baby" like tryin' on clothes

Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

And all at once, you are the one I have been waitin' for
King of my heart, body and soul, woah
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body and soul, woah

And all at once
I've been waitin', waitin'
Woah, woah
And all at once
You are the one, I have been waitin', waitin'
Body and soul, woah
And all at once

Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury

Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room (Inside my room, oh)
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)

And all at once, you are the one I have been waitin' for
King of my heart, body and soul, woah
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body and soul, woah

And all at once (Hey)
I've been waitin', waitin' (Waiting)
Woah, woah
And all at once
You are the one I have been waitin' (Waitin'), waitin' (Waitin')
Body and soul, woah
And all at once
Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinkin' beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough

And all at once, you are the one I have been waitin' for
King of my heart, body and soul, woah (And all at once)

And all at once, you are the one I have been waitin' for
King of my heart, body and soul, woah
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body and soul (My soul), woah

And all at once
I've been waitin', waitin'
Woah, woah (Woah)
And all at once
You are the one I have been waitin', waitin'
Body and soul, woah
And all at once53Embed
